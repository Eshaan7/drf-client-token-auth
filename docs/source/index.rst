Per API client token authentication Module for Django-REST-Framework_

The idea is to provide one library that does token auth for multiple Web/CLI/Mobile API clients via one interface but allows different token configuration for each client.

Durin authentication is token based, similar to the ``TokenAuthentication``
built in to DRF. However, it adds some extra sauce:

- Durin allows **multiple tokens** per user. But only one token each user per API client.
- Each user token is associated with an API Client. 

   - These API Clients (:class:`durin.models.Client`) are configurable via Django's Admin Interface. 
   - Includes Permission-enforcing_ to allow only specific clients to make authenticated requests to certain ``APIViews`` or vice-a-versa.
   - Configure Rate-Throttling_ per User <-> Client pair.
- All Durin **tokens have an expiration time**. This expiration time can be different per API client.
- Durin provides an option for a logged in user to **remove all tokens** that the server has - forcing him/her to re-authenticate for all API clients.
- Durin **tokens can be renewed** to get a fresh expiry.
- Durin provides a :class:`durin.auth.CachedTokenAuthentication` backend as well which uses memoization for faster look ups.
- Durin provides **Session-Management** features. Refer to Session-Management-Views_ i.e.,
   - REST view for an authenticated user to get list of sessions (in context of django-rest-durin, this means ``AuthToken`` instances) and revoke a session. Useful for pages like "View active browser sessions".
   - REST view for an authenticated user to get/create/delete token against a pre-defined client. Useful for pages like "Get API key" where a user can get an API key to be able to interact directly with your project's RESTful API using cURL or a custom client.
